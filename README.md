### Population file
- This project was a lab activity whose goal was to preview how long it would take (in years) for a llama population chosen by the user to achieve the final population, also chosen by the user. We assumed that 1/3 of llamas of the start population are born annually, and 1/4 die.
- The project scope was divided into four parts:
  * Asking the user for a start population;
  * Asking the user for a final population;
  * Calculating the number of years required;
  * Printing the result on the screen;
