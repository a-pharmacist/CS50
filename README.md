# CS50
Projects and problems solved during CS50 Harvard courses.

## Lecture 1 - C

### Population file
- This project was a lab activity whose goal was to preview how long it would take (in years) for a llama population chosen by the user to achieve the final population, also chosen by the user. We assumed that 1/3 of llamas of the start population are born annually, and 1/4 die.
- The project scope was divided into four parts:
  * Asking the user for a start population;
  * Asking the user for a final population;
  * Calculating the number of years required;
  * Printing the result on the screen;

### Mario file
- Inspired by Mario games, this challenge's goal was to ask the user for an integer number that would result in a pyramid's height. 
- The project scope was divided into three parts:
  * Creating a formula to calculate the pyramid's height;
  * Creating a formula to calculate the number of spaces " " before each line;
  * Creating a formula to calculate the number of hashes on each line.
 
 ### Cash file
- This project aims to show how many coins are owed in change. 
- There are four coin types: quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). 
- This algorithm receives a value greater than one and stores it. Then, it must calculate how many coins are necessary to cover the change owed. For instance:
  * If the input is 0, the output must be 0;
  * If the input is 4, the output must be 4 (i.e., four pennies);
  * If the input is 24, the output must be 6 (i.e., two dimes and four pennies).

## Lecture 2 - Arrays

### Hours file
- This project aims to calculate, according to the user preferences (sum or average), how much time was spent over the weeks during the CS50 course.
