# CS50
Projects and problems solved during CS50 Harvard courses.

## Lecture 1 - C

### Practice Problems

#### Half file
- Supposing the user is going to a restaurant with another person, this program aims to calculate how much each one should pay, including bill, tax, and tip values.

#### Prime file
- This project aims to show the user (based on a chosen range) what Prime numbers exist.

### Lab 1

#### Population file
- This project was a lab activity whose goal was to preview how long it would take (in years) for a llama population chosen by the user to achieve the final population, also chosen by the user. We assumed that 1/3 of llamas of the start population are born annually, and 1/4 die.
- The project scope was divided into four parts:
  * Asking the user for a start population;
  * Asking the user for a final population;
  * Calculating the number of years required;
  * Printing the result on the screen;

### Problem set 1

#### Mario file
- Inspired by Mario games, this challenge's goal was to ask the user for an integer number that would result in a pyramid's height. 
- The project scope was divided into three parts:
  * Creating a formula to calculate the pyramid's height;
  * Creating a formula to calculate the number of spaces " " before each line;
  * Creating a formula to calculate the number of hashes on each line.
 
 #### Cash file
- This project aims to show how many coins are owed in change. 
- There are four coin types: quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). 
- This algorithm receives a value greater than one and stores it. Then, it must calculate how many coins are necessary to cover the change owed. For instance:
  * If the input is 0, the output must be 0;
  * If the input is 4, the output must be 4 (i.e., four pennies);
  * If the input is 24, the output must be 6 (i.e., two dimes and four pennies).

## Lecture 2 - Arrays

### Practice Problems

#### Hours file
- This project aims to calculate, according to the user preferences (sum or average), how much time was spent over the weeks during the CS50 course.

#### No-vowels file
- This project aims to change every vowel - except 'u' - to numbers in a string, which is an array of characters.

#### Password file
- This project aims to evaluate if a password chosen by the user is valid or not valid and prints the result on the screen.
- A valid password must have:
  * At least one number;
  * At least one lowercase letter;
  * At least one uppercase letter;
  * At least one symbol.

 ### Lab 2

 #### Scrabble file
 - This project is a game in which two players must choose a word. Each character in these words has several points according to how difficult it is to find it in a word (i.e., the 'a' value's is 1, and the 'z' value's is 10). 
- In the end, it's printed on the screen which player is the winner (or if they have a tie) according to the sum of the points of each symbol.
- Rules:
  * The letters 'A' and 'a' have the same number of points;
  * Non-alphabetical characters count as 0 points.

### Problem set 2

#### Bulbs file
- This project aims to get a message from the user, like "Hi!". After, it transforms each character used into an integer and converts the decimal number into binary.
- Then, the result is printed on the screen in bulbs emoji format. The number 1 is represented as an on light bulb, and the number 0 as an off one.
  * Each character must be represented in a different line.
